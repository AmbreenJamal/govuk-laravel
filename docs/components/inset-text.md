# Inset Text

Create an indented block of text, useful for quotes and text that would be considered aside.

```html
<x-govuk::inset-text>
    Some text that is additional to the main content
</x-govuk::inset-text>
```

The inset text content does not need to be wrapped in an HTML tag, but can include them.
